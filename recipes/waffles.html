      <h3>Waffle Ingredients </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong>All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong>Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
        <li><strong> Oil: </strong>A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong>Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooking spray:</strong> You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles. </li>
